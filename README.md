# BCI-Development-Playground

List of resources for learning, developing, and exploring the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces.

##  Foundational Knowledge
### 1. Core Neuroscience & BCI Theory
- **[Medical Neuroscience (Duke University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience):** A comprehensive course on the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system and the biological basis of BCI.
- **[Computational Neuroscience (University of Pennsylvania)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience):** Bridges biology and computation by teaching how to model neurons and networks. The "how" we can mathematically describe neural activity.
- **[The Mind and the Machine (University of Colorado)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mind-machine):** Directly addresses BCI applications, signal processing for neural data (like EEG), and the practical aspects of creating a BCI. The "what" we build with this knowledge.

### 2. Core Technical Skills
- **Linear Algebra:** **[3Blue1Brown's Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMSUeMus_o2aD_L-BOI6x-h)** - A visual, intuitive guide to linear algebra, which is the bedrock of machine learning and signal processing.
- **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** **[DSP Illustrated (Online Book)](https://dspillustrations.com/)** or **[Coursera's Digital Signal Processing (EPFL)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/digital-signal-processing)** - Critical for cleaning, filtering, and interpreting noisy neural data. These resources include Python examples for practical application.
- **Python for Data Science:** **[Data Analysis with Python (freeCodeCamp Course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8)** or **[Coursera's Python for Everybody (University of Michigan)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-for-everybody)** - Essential for implementing BCI algorithms, with focus on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

## Key BCI Paradigms

Understanding these core concepts is key to working with the projects and datasets below.

- **Motor Imagery (MI):** The act of imagining a motor movement without any actual muscle activation. The brain patterns for imagined and real movements are similar, allowing a BCI to detect a user's intent (e.g., imagining left vs. right-hand movement).
- **P300 Event-Related Potential (ERP):** A specific brain signal that appears as a positive voltage spike roughly 300ms after a person sees a rare or significant "target" stimulus. This is often used for BCI spellers, where target letters flash in a grid.
- **Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP):** A natural brain response to looking at a light flickering at a specific frequency. By having multiple lights flickering at different frequencies, a BCI can determine which light the user is looking at, allowing them to issue commands.

## Development Playground

This section contains the tools and data you need to start building.

> **Pro Tip:** Start with offline datasets before moving to real-time hardware. This will help you learn the fundamentals of signal processing and machine learning without the added frustration of dealing with noisy live signals and hardware issues.

### 1. Software & Libraries

- **[PyBCI](https://github.com/LMBooth/pybci):** A high-level Python library designed for rapid prototyping of BCIs with real-time data streams.
- **[OpenViBE](http://openvibe.inria.fr/):** A popular open-source software platform for designing and testing BCIs with a graphical, no-code-required interface.

### 2. Public Datasets
- **[MOABB (Mother of all BCI Benchmarks)](https://moabb.neurotechx.com/docs/index.html):** A Python framework that provides easy access to dozens of BCI datasets (Motor Imagery, SSVEP, P300) and tools for benchmarking algorithms.
- **[PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/):** A massive repository of physiological signals and medical data, including many EEG datasets for BCI experiments.
- **[BCI Competition Datasets](http://www.bbci.de/competition/):** Old classic datasets from past BCI competitions, often used as benchmarks in academic papers.

### 3. Beginner Project Ideas
- **Motor Imagery BCI:** The "Hello, World!" of BCI. A project to classify whether a user is imagining left or right-hand movement from EEG data.
  - ***Tutorial tip:*** *Use MOABB to easily download datasets and MNE-Python to build the classification pipeline.*
- **P300 Speller:** Build a simple speller based on the P300 event-related potential.
  - ***Tutorial tip:*** *This is a paradigm for a real-time app using a headset compatible with BrainFlow.*
- **SSVEP Controller:** A project where looking at flickering lights at different frequencies can be used to issue commands or control a cursor.
  - ***Tutorial tip:*** *Try prototyping this quickly with OpenViBE's graphical designer before writing any code.*
